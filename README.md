# Summary

Starting with Boost Day #3 on March 11th, 2021 Shopware will answer questions from the community **during the intro presentation** of the [Shopware Boost Day](https://ecommerce.shopware.com/boost-days).

[This repository](https://github.com/shopwareBoostDay/ask-me-anything) is used to collect the questions from you prior to the event(s).

In order to ask a question please [open an issue](https://github.com/shopwareBoostDay/ask-me-anything/issues/new/choose) after checking if your question is not already in the issue list.

You are also encouraged to vote for existing questions by giving the issue a thumbs up. üëç

# Requirements for questions

There are no requirements, other than being polite and reasonable.

Questions with high upvote counts will be answered first. But as you may understand, we can't or in some cases don't want to answer every question, regardless of the upvote count.

If we close your issue and thus won't answer your question we will tell you why.

As a rule of thumb: If the answer really interests you, it's a good question.

You can of course also ask "fun" things. If the Shopware CEOs choice of breakfast is really important to you, ask. But Shopware will only answer a few of those questions per Boost Day. üòâ 

# Voting for existing questions

It's fairly simple. Just give the issue itself a thumbs-up (üëç) via the reaction/emoji menu.

# Asking anonymously

Using github to collect questions has a lot of advantages, anonymity is not one of them.
In the future we will look into providing a solution similar to [gitreports](https://github.com/schneidmaster/gitreports.com), until then you need to use a github account that is not connected to your real-life data in order to interact with this repository anonymously.
